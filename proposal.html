        <h1>Ray Tracing and Beyond</h1>
        <p>
            Our goal in this project is to design and implement a faster, more efficient, and more feature-loaded ray
            tracer
            than the one implemented as part of project 3.
        </p>
        <b>
            Project Description
        </b>
        <p>
            Ray tracing is a powerful technique to render various scenes, but it can also be slow and inefficient,
            especially when sending out many rays into the scene to render. To address these issues, we plan to add
            optimizations and features inspired by Hyperion, a renderer by Disney. The challenges in this project
            involve
            figuring out how to efficiently optimize our ray tracer, adding new techniques, and exploring how to best
            demonstrate our ray tracer's ability to render complex scenes.
        </p>
        <b>We plan to deliver</b>
        <p>Main questions: What technique(s) best work for what scenes (e.g. different lighting)? What are the
            performance
            improvements resulting from each optimization technique?
        </p>

        <ul>

            <li>
                Implementation of the <b>cache points</b> optimization. Based on the Hyperion paper, cache points is an
                optimization technique for ray tracer to render complex scenes with lots of light by first randomly
                generating cache points based on a distribution, updating the cache points in iterations, and sampling a
                light from a cache point.


                <ul>
                    <li>Show and compare the speedup and performance of using cache points to render a scene with lots
                        of
                        lights vs using a simple ray tracer.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Implementation of <b>photon mapping</b> as a novel technique in addition to standard ray tracing. Photon
                mapping involves sending photons from a light source into the scene and storing their intersections and
                incident directions in a photon map.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Show and compare the performance of using photon mapping to render scenes vs using a simple ray
                        tracer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Show and compare image quality (noise and variance) using photon mapping to render scenes vs no
                        photon mapping.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Able to render scenes like the following:
                        <img src="images/photon-mapping1.png" height="150px">
                        <img src="images/photon-mapping2.jpg" height="150px">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some example <b>metrics</b> of interest: time to render, number of intersection tests,
                        iterations
                        till convergence, ability to render advanced lighting effects (e.g. caustics)

                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <b>We hope to deliver</b>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Optimizations to photon mapping. Photon mapping can be improved with <b>shadow photons</b>. When a
                photon
                intersects an
                object in a scene, a shadow photon in the direction of the light source can also be generated and its
                intersection with any object is stored in the photon map. Upon calculating direct illumination with
                raytracing,
                if a photon has a direct path to a light, additional intersections can be ignored.</li>

            <li>Porting ray tracing and photon mapping to <b>GPU</b>. Raytracing and photon mapping involve generating
                parallel rays or
                photons in batches, a process that benefits greatly from increased parallelism using GPUs.</li>
        </ul>
